Video_State_Machine_32k_20220121_SuperElf
Excel file used for generating the byte code patterns.

gen_32K_asm_v25.pl
A Perl script that is populated with the byte code patterns
produced by the Excel file.  Sequences of the byte code
are generated to represent the pattern of activity that
the EEPROM state machine should produce based on a counter.

If you do not have a Perl interpreter, I recommend the free and
public version provided by ActiveState.

The script will generate an .asm file that can be assembled
by the A18 assember.  Sample HEX and BIN files provided as well.
